Status: WIP

This will eventually be a set of problems/exercises in OCaml that you can work through to create a clone of FFTW in OCaml. All the magic of evaluating OCaml code is done by [`js_of_ocaml`](https://github.com/ocsigen/js_of_ocaml).

Please note: The platform may have bugs; exercises may have typos and/or incorrect information. Please do open an issue or drop me an email if you find any of them. If you wish to contribute, please open a discussion.
